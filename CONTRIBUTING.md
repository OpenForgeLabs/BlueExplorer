# Contributing to BlueExplorer

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide explains how to report issues and submit changes.

## Getting started

- Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `master`.
- Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
- Run tests or provide manual validation steps.

## Issues

Before opening a new issue, search for existing ones.

Use the issue templates to report:
- Bugs (steps, expected vs actual, logs/screenshots)
- Feature requests (problem, proposed solution, alternatives)

## Pull requests

PRs should include:
- Clear summary of changes
- Testing notes (commands or manual steps)
- Screenshots for UI changes

We recommend:
- One feature or fix per PR
- No large refactors mixed with unrelated changes

## Code style

- Follow existing code patterns and naming.
- Keep TypeScript and C# formatting consistent with current style.

## Commit messages

Use concise messages. Example: `fix: handle redis key refresh loop`.
